# Introduction
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses, is a classic two-Player game. The goal of this project was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe board which is able to monitor the state of a game and return the win/loose/draw state of the game after each player's move. The game allows two players to play against each other.

# Rules
* Two players take turns: placing 'X' and 'O' marks in empty spaces on a 3x3 square grid.
* Player with the 'X' mark starts first anywhere in the 3x3 square grid.Then the second Player with 'O' marks fill the empty space which they want.
* The player who first place 3 marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row wins the game match.
* If all spaces are filled and we cann't decide the winner of the game, the game ends in a draw.
